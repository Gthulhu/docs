# Project Goals

This page introduces the design philosophy, development objectives, and future vision of the Gthulhu and SCX GoLand Core projects.

## Project Vision

### Core Mission

**Making Linux schedulers smarter, more efficient, and better adapted to modern application requirements**

With the proliferation of cloud-native applications, containerized deployments, and microservice architectures, traditional schedulers can no longer fully meet the diverse needs of modern workloads. The Gthulhu project is committed to:

- üéØ **Providing Low-Latency Scheduling**: Better responsiveness for interactive applications and real-time systems
- üöÄ **Optimizing Cloud-Native Environments**: Designed specifically for containerized and microservice environments
- üîß **Supporting Extensible Architecture**: Enabling developers to easily customize scheduling policies
- üìä **Data-Driven Approach**: Continuously optimizing scheduling decisions using actual runtime data

## Design Principles

### 1. Performance First

    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
```

- **Microsecond-Level Scheduling Latency**: Target scheduling decision time at microsecond level
- **Minimize Context Switch Overhead**: Reduce unnecessary context switches through intelligent task allocation
- **Zero-Copy Data Transfer**: Avoid data copying whenever possible

### 2. Adaptive Design

```yaml
Design Features:
  Dynamic Adjustment: Automatically adjust scheduling parameters based on system load
  Learning Capability: Learn optimal scheduling patterns from historical data
  Environment Awareness: Automatically identify different application scenarios and workloads
  Flexible Configuration: Support runtime parameter adjustment without system restart
```

### 3. Developer Friendly

- **Clear API Design**: Provide concise and intuitive programming interfaces
- **Rich Debugging Tools**: Built-in detailed monitoring and debugging capabilities
- **Complete Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation from beginner to advanced
- **Active Community Support**: Build an open and friendly developer community

## Target Application Scenarios
